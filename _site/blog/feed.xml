        <title>Pomchos &amp; Up</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long day of R troubleshooting, laptop charger searching, and math proof-solving, I visited Pom dining hall to eat the weekly nachos (Pomchos) and guacamole. Of course, I spent a couple of hours sitting there because not only the Whiptails but also the Caz family came to eat, chat, and laugh in the dining hall. In the evening, the Caz family watched the Pixar movie Up. My favorite moment was Anna pointing out that she and the old man share many characteristics (back problems, clumsiness, etc). Overall, I enjoyed a solid Saturday night with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unexpected Lunch</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;BamBam brought me lunch today. I originally planned to replacing lunch with in-class snacks since I was busy finishing an essay in Pendleton for my sociology class. Instead, I ate a delicious, delivered wrap. I feel fortunate to know someone with such a kind soul as BamBam’s.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Strength in community</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The best part of my day was hanging out with Twitch and the Whiptails in Caz basement after dinner. We baked treats and studied together. In light of fellow student An Ton’s passage, I appreciate that friends on campus came together to decompress and to take care of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIP An.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Catching Up with Friends</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of great things happened today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I talked to Kelly Z. and Emily Ahn during lunch today. The conversations were special because they’re people who I haven’t talked to yet this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) I convinced Cali to go on the Whiptail spring break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Cali and I started emailing each other about the best part of our days. I’m pleased that there’s an element of accountability to the happiness project now. Plus it makes me happy to read about the special parts of Cali’s.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bonding Over Dvorak</title>

        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://m.eganchen.com/2015/02/03/Bonding-Over-Dvorak.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found a very nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3-ZniwXSYY&quot; title=&quot;The Best of Dvorak&quot;&gt;The Best of Dvorak&lt;/a&gt; video last night while I was studying. I like the video because it contains a lot of pieces that I’ve played in high school. I sent it to my brother, who responded by sending me Dvořák’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8-wQZUQ99A&quot; title=&quot;Antonín Dvořák -Scherzo Capriccioso, Op. 66&quot;&gt;Scherzo Capriccioso, Op. 66&lt;/a&gt;. Not surprisingly, I loved the Scherzo. I’m pleased that my brother and I bonded over Dvořák.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Super Bowl Sunday</title>
        <link>http://m.eganchen.com/2015/02/02/Super-Bowl-Sunday.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://m.eganchen.com/2015/02/02/Super-Bowl-Sunday.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the Super Bowl: Patriots vs the Seahawks. I wasn’t rooting for any team in particular, but I had a blast watching the game with the Whiptails in Pomeroy living room. This semester’s social chairs Beckham (Maja) and Turf (Cat) set up a projector and ordered pizza and wings from Dominos. The whole setup was quite impressive. Though I wasn’t super invested in the game, watching the Seahawks/Patriots cheering sections was extremely entertaining. Katy Perry’s halftime show was on point: I want one of the shark costumes for Halloween next year. Also, I learned from Allen that the Madden NFL game accurately predicted the score &amp;amp; outcome of the game. Creepy right? &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ringing Bells in the Old North Church</title>
        <link>http://m.eganchen.com/2015/02/01/Ringing-Bells-in-the-Old-North-Church.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://m.eganchen.com/2015/02/01/Ringing-Bells-in-the-Old-North-Church.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I spent the morning learning how to ring tower bells with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bellringers.scripts.mit.edu/www/&quot; title=&quot;MIT&#39;s Guild of Bellringers&quot;&gt;MIT’s Guild of Bellringers&lt;/a&gt; at the Old North Church. I found out about this opportunity from Davie after mentioning that I would be in town for the Battlecode wrap-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old North Church has 8 tower bells. A bell rings when a bellringer pulls on the ropes hanging from the ceiling. The MIT Bellringers were kind enough to teach everyone (Davie, me, and two MIT grad students) the basic techniques of pulling the ropes. A bellringer must pull the rope twice: the handstroke (pulling down on the fuzzy red and black-striped part of the rope) and the backstroke (pulling down on the end of the rope after it shoots up into the ceiling). Accordingly, the bell strikes twice. I picked up the pulling technique quickly, but the next steps -memorizing the bell rounds and learning to play in time with other people- supposedly take years to master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2015-02-01/BellRopes&amp;amp;Window.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bell Ropes and Window&quot; title=&quot;Bell Ropes and Window&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lessons, the Bellringers sent the newbies up to the bell room to watch the bells in action while the Bellringers performed some short rounds.

Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: The bells in the Old North Church are the originals cast in 1744.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, the whole group grabbed lunch from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ernestosnorthend.com/index.html&quot; title=&quot;Ernesto&#39;s&quot;&gt;Ernesto’s&lt;/a&gt;. The slice of pizza that I received is the largest I’ve ever ordered. I ate the whole thing too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2015-02-01/ernestospizza.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ernesto&#39;s Pizza Slice&quot; title=&quot;Ernesto&#39;s Pizza Slice&quot; /&gt;
Note: The slice was cut in half prior to serving, hence the two slices in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bell ringing experience was truly special: I feel like I discovered one of Boston’s secret treasures. I’m very thankful that I’m taking advantage of the cool things (like this) that MIT’s IAP period has to offer. I’m also thankful that I got to catch up with Davie - we haven’t talked for months besides the time in January when we met by chance in Bldg 10.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Practice of many firsts</title>
        <link>http://m.eganchen.com/2015/01/31/practice-of-many-firsts.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://m.eganchen.com/2015/01/31/practice-of-many-firsts.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening, I went to the first Whiptail practice of the semester. It was our first practice in the brand-spanking-new field house in the Keohane Sports Center (KSC). I’m extremely pleased abou the aesthetics of the gym: the gray and blue color scheme and the beautiful basketball court. Most importantly, the Whiptails have more indoor space to run around! Previously, we were trying to squeeze everyone into the upstairs gym, which made doing drills such as “Go to” somewhat frustrating due to limited space and long lines. Despite everyone’s groaning about campus renovations, I think that the field house turned out wonderfully. I’m excited to take advantage of the new facilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing more fun than chasing around a frisbee. I’m super glad that I have a team to practice with regularly again. I’m looking forward to all the tournaments and Whiptail bonding for the coming semester.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happiness Blog Project / America vs Taiwan Podcast</title>
        <link>http://m.eganchen.com/2015/01/29/happiness-blog-project.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://m.eganchen.com/2015/01/29/happiness-blog-project.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently watched a TED talk called “The happy secret to better work” by Shawn Achor, a researcher about positive psychology. Here’s the video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fLJsdqxnZb0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk inspired me to take charge of building lasting personal happiness. I’ve decided to start this blog to journal the high points of my day. I will spend a couple minutes per day describing a positive experience over the last 24 hours. Posts are not meant to be tomes, just quick reflections about the best parts of my day. Hopefully, by focusing on my daily highlights, I’ll become better at appreciating the little things in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For today’s highlight, I found a Mandarin podcast called America vs Taiwan. I’ve regularly spent time searching for a fun Mandarin podcasts to maintain my Chinese skills and to satisfy my nostalgia for hearing a Taiwanese accent. Additionally, the podcast promises to talk with real-life Mandarin, not the formal speak reserved for beginner language learners. Judging from the podcast’s iTunes description, I’ll pick up some explicit slang that my parents (thankfully) don’t say. If you’re curious, the podcast can be downloaded on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/america-vs-taiwan/id325438092?mt=2&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
