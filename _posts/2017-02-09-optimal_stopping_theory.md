title: Wikipedia Opening about Optimal Stopping Theory
---

In mathematics, __optimal stopping theory__ is a subfield of [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) motivated by observing a [random process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) evolving over time and making a decision (i.e. finding a [stopping rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopping_time)) that achieves an optimal result.

One of the first discoveries in optimal stopping theory occurred in 1875, when [Arthur Cayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cayley) devised an optimal stopping strategy for buying lottery tickets. Since then optimal stopping theory has inspired fields such as statistical [sequential analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_analysis), which helped make militaristic and industrial gambles in [WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), and [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming), which uses computational methods to solve [optimization problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem). More recently, the 1997 [Nobel Prize in Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences) was awarded for the discovery of the [Black-Scholes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model#Black-Scholes_formula), which is the foundation of modern [options pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_of_options). Even today, optimal stopping theory has various applications in [gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance), [resource management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_management), and [military strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy).

In full information optimal stopping problems, the total number of trials, possible observed values, and probabilities of seeing each value are all known. For example, roll a standard, fair [die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice) up to five times, with the goal of maximizing the rolled number. Finding the optimal solution for this type of problem often utilizes the [backwards induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_induction) technique: first find the strategy which achieves the best solution at the last stage of the problem (at the $N$th trial). Then, knowing this strategy, work backwards to find the optimal solution at each stage ($N - 1$, $N - 2$, $\ldots$). Backwards induction doesn’t require the assumption of independence between the trials. 

Certain optimal stopping problems contain no information about the values that will be observed. A famous problem of this type is the [marriage problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem): suppose $N$ suitors are randomly interviewed one-by-one. Each suitor must be irrevocably accepted or rejected immediately after his/her interview. What’s the strategy to choose the best suitor? In general, given $N$ sequential trials, is there a way to choose the best result? The optimal solution involves observing the first $\frac{N}{e}$ trials (where $e$ ≈ 2.71828) then choosing the next-observed best or “record” trial. An extension of this problem is finding one of the best $k$ values of $N$ trials. 

A surprising result occurs in the case $N = 2$. This can be modelled by flipping two cards, aiming to stop at the highest card. After generating a random value $R$ using a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), flip the second card only if $R$ is greater than the first card. This strategy gives a probability of success greater than 0.5.

Partial information problems can have an unknown number of total trials or unknown probabilities assigned to each possible observed value. Solving this type of problem often utilizes tools from [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory): many problems can be modelled using [zero-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game), two-person games where a decision maker plays against “Nature” or “God”, a player who arbitrarily assigns values and probabilities.

Unsolved optimal stopping problems remain abundant. For example, no one has found the optimal stopping rule for repeatedly tossing a fair coin and stopping in order to maximize the percentage of heads.
