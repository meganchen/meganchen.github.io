Yesterday evening, I went to the first Whiptail practice of the semester. It was our first practice in the brand-spanking-new field house in the Keohane Sports Center (KSC). I'm extremely pleased abou the aesthetics of the gym: the gray and blue color scheme and the beautiful basketball court. Most importantly, the Whiptails have more indoor space to run around! Previously, we were trying to squeeze everyone into the upstairs gym, which made doing drills such as "Go to" somewhat frustrating due to limited space and long lines. Despite everyone's groaning about campus renovations, I think that the field house turned out wonderfully. I'm excited to take advantage of the new facilities. 

There's nothing more fun than chasing around a frisbee. I'm super glad that I have a team to practice with regularly again. I'm looking forward to all the tournaments and Whiptail bonding for the coming semester.
