I found a very nice [The Best of Dvorak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3-ZniwXSYY "The Best of Dvorak") video last night while I was studying. I like the video because it contains a lot of pieces that I've played in high school. I sent it to my brother, who responded by sending me Dvořák's [Scherzo Capriccioso, Op. 66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8-wQZUQ99A "Antonín Dvořák -Scherzo Capriccioso, Op. 66"). Not surprisingly, I loved the Scherzo. I'm pleased that my brother and I bonded over Dvořák.
