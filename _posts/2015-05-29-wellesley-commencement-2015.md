A bittersweet day.

This morning was sad in that the seniors graduated. This afternoon was sad in that I left Wellesley and won't be back until next January. Result: I won't see my best friends for a long long while.

This morning was great in that the seniors graduated. Their accomplishments at Wellesley are all so great, and it's time for them to go start kicking butt in the real world. Congratulations to them all.
