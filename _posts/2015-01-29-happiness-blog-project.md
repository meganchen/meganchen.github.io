Hi everyone! 

I recently watched a TED talk called "The happy secret to better work" by Shawn Achor, a researcher about positive psychology. Here's the video:

The talk inspired me to take charge of building lasting personal happiness. I've decided to start this blog to journal the high points of my day. I will spend a couple minutes per day describing a positive experience over the last 24 hours. Posts are not meant to be tomes, just quick reflections about the best parts of my day. Hopefully, by focusing on my daily highlights, I'll become better at appreciating the little things in life.

For today's highlight, I found a Mandarin podcast called America vs Taiwan. I've regularly spent time searching for a fun Mandarin podcasts to maintain my Chinese skills and to satisfy my nostalgia for hearing a Taiwanese accent. Additionally, the podcast promises to talk with real-life Mandarin, not the formal speak reserved for beginner language learners. Judging from the podcast's iTunes description, I'll pick up some explicit slang that my parents (thankfully) don't say. If you're curious, the podcast can be downloaded on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/america-vs-taiwan/id325438092?mt=2">iTunes</a>.
