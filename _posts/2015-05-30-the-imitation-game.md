This evening my family and I watched *The Imitation Game*, a movie about the life of Alan Turing. I really enjoyed the movie - it inspired me to think on a couple of deep questions in terms of my relationships with myself, others, and the world, as all great movies should. 

My favorite quote from the movie is this: 

*"Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of, who do the things that no one can imagine."*
