A couple of great things happened today:

1) I talked to Kelly Z. and Emily Ahn during lunch today. The conversations were special because they're people who I haven't talked to yet this semester.

2) I convinced Cali to go on the Whiptail spring break.

3) Cali and I started emailing each other about the best part of our days. I'm pleased that there's an element of accountability to the happiness project now. Plus it makes me happy to read about the special parts of Cali's.
