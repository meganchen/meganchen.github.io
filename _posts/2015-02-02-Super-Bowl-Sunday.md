Last night was the Super Bowl: Patriots vs the Seahawks. I wasn't rooting for any team in particular, but I had a blast watching the game with the Whiptails in Pomeroy living room. This semester's social chairs Beckham (Maja) and Turf (Cat) set up a projector and ordered pizza and wings from Dominos. The whole setup was quite impressive. Though I wasn't super invested in the game, watching the Seahawks/Patriots cheering sections was extremely entertaining. Katy Perry's halftime show was on point: I want one of the shark costumes for Halloween next year. Also, I learned from Allen that the Madden NFL game accurately predicted the score & outcome of the game. Creepy right?
