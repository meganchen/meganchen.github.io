From 9:00-11:00pm, Whiptails with phones and headphones danced around Wellesley's campus. The idea was born from a silent dance party that Haley, AJ, and I stumbled upon in the North End of Boston the past summer. This time, I put together the music stream using Radionomy, and we danced. We began in Tower Great Hall and progressed through Tower Courtyard, the Quad, and ended in the Lulu. It was a wonderful last night at Wellesley with some of my best friends on campus - the Whiptails.
