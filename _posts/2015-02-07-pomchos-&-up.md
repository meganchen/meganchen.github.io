After a long day of R troubleshooting, laptop charger searching, and math proof-solving, I visited Pom dining hall to eat the weekly nachos (Pomchos) and guacamole. Of course, I spent a couple of hours sitting there because not only the Whiptails but also the Caz family came to eat, chat, and laugh in the dining hall. In the evening, the Caz family watched the Pixar movie Up. My favorite moment was Anna pointing out that she and the old man share many characteristics (back problems, clumsiness, etc). Overall, I enjoyed a solid Saturday night with friends.
